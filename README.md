## 🔐 What is D1Goat0-PentestTools?

**D1Goat0-PentestTools** is a one-stop collection of **penetration testing tools**, **firmware**, **scripts**, and **3D-printable STL files** for custom hacking devices.  
Built by **D1Goat0**, this toolkit powers advanced security testing, infiltration missions, and hands-on hardware hacking.

Whether you're a red teamer, hardware modder, or security researcher — this is built for you.

## ⚡ What Makes It Different?

Most repos offer one or two scripts. We go **all-in**.

### ✅ Full Package for Every Device

Every device we feature includes:

- STL files for 3D-printed cases/enclosures  
- Flashable firmware or payloads  
- Usage instructions and setup guides  
- Hardware links to buy or build it yourself

### 🔥 Not Just Tools — Field-Tested Gear

All tools are used in **real-world scenarios** by D1Goat0 and collaborators. These aren’t experiments — they’re field-tested for performance, stealth, and effectiveness.

### 🚫 No Gatekeeping, No Paywall

Everything here is **free**, **open**, and **ready to use**. We believe in empowering the community — not hiding behind subscriptions or locked content.
